# Knowledge graph paper examples

This repository contains examples in concrete syntaxes from the Knowledge Graphs published with ACM CSUR.

If you find any material in the paper or this repository useful, please cite it as:


## Overview



The examples are divided into folders for each subsection according to the ACM CSUR version of the paper.
To find a particular example you can also search by the name of a particular figure in the repository (e.g., "figure4", "table2", etc.).
In cases where there are multiple competing standards to implement some concepts, we try to include all.
Thus, there are sometimes multiple implementations per figure with different file extensions.

Since many different file formats and standards are used in this repository, we try to include comments that point to documentation of the respecitve standards, indicate where you can try out the examples online, or otherwise where you can find code relating to the example and the discussion it the paper.
